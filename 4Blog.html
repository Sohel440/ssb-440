            <h2>ABOUT C PROGRAMMING:</h2>

            <p>C is one of the most important programming language in the world of programming. In This post we will learn about the History of C Language OR Basics OF C Language. This tutorial is dedicated to beginners that they can get C Language Basics Notes or You can say that this tutorial provides Basics Of C Language for Beginners.

                In this post we will know about the Introduction OF C Language and  What is C Langauge as well as History of C Programming Language. you will find C Language Basic Notes in this article.</p>

        <div class="history">
            <h2>History of c language:</h2>
            <p>Before the invention of C, Martin Richards developed A Programming Language 'Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL)' in 1966. Which (BCPL) was combination of features of many programming languages.

                Ken Thompson, who was working in AT&T Bell Labs created a new language which is called 'B' by improving BCPL in 1969. He wanted to develop a new operating system, for that purpose he developed a new programming language i.e. 'B' after that he developed the Operating System (Unix).
                
                Dennis Ritchie, who was also working in AT&T Bell Labs, developed C-Language in 1972 by improving 'B-Language', And they (Ken Thompson And Dennis Ritchie) Re-design the Operating System (Unix) in C-Language.      
                <h4>Main</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>- C is a programming language which is developed by Dennis Ritchie at BELL Labs in 1972</li>
                    <li>- Dennis Ritchie is called the father of C-Language.
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>
                C-Language was Created by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs in 1972, For Develop an Operating system that is Unix. C is widely used for creating various types of Software. C is a very powerful Programming Language it is very close to system hardware so system software can be easily developed in C.
                
                in this post we learnt About The History Of C Language, C language Basics And The Importance Of C Language And Now we also know that Who Introduced C Language. we see the list of software that are developed using c language, 
                
                
                If you feel that this article is useful for you, then please share it with your friends, your share will motivate me to post more article about c-language</p>
